# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis repository! This repository contains SQL scripts used to perform exploratory data analysis on various datasets. The goal of EDA is to understand the underlying patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

## Repository Structure

- **DataCleaning.sql**: This SQL script containing all the queries for the Data Cleaning process.
- **ExploratoryDataAnalysis.sql**: The main SQL script containing all the queries and analysis steps for the EDA process.

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, you need to have a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other SQL-compatible database.

### Prerequisites

- A SQL-compatible DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Basic understanding of SQL

## Analysis Overview

The SQL script performs the following steps:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Summarizes data to find key metrics
2. **Ranking**: Ranks data based on specific criteria.
3. **Filtering and Sorting**: Filters and sorts data to identify patterns and outliers.
4. **Calculations**: Performs calculations such as sums and averages to derive insights.
